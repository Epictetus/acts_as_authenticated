acts_as_authenticated generator
====

This is a basic authentication generator for rails, very much in the spirit of xal's original Login Generator.

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user account

This generates a basic user model, a controller, some basic views, and tests.  Plenty of comments are provided to help you progress.
